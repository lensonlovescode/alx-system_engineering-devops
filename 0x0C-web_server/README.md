## 0x0C-web_server
In this project, some of the tasks will be graded on 2 aspects:
1. Is your web-01 server configured according to requirements
2. Does your answer file contain a Bash script that automatically performs commands to configure an Ubuntu machine to fit requirements (meaning without any human intervention)
