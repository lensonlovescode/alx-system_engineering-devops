This directory contains projects and scripts that demonstrate the use of regular expressions (regex) for text processing.
The focus of this project is to build and experiment with regex using Oniguruma, the default regex library in Ruby.
Note that some properties may vary across different libraries, so Oniguruma-specific behavior is emphasized.
Practical examples in Ruby are provided, where you can replace the regexp part in the given Ruby code to test various patterns.
