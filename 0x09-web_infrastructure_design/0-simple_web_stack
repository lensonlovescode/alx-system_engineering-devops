Some specifics about this infrastructure:

1. What is a server
A server is a computer that provides information to other computers called "clients" on demand over a network
2. What is the role of the domain name
A domain name gives easy to remember names to computers which are identified by ip addresses
3. What type of DNS record www is in www.foobar.com
It is a CNAME record because it aliases www.foobar.com to just foobar.com, which are effectively the same destination
4. What is the role of the web server
A web server 'serves' web content such as html documents files or other data to clients over the internet
5. What is the role of the application server
An application handles the logic of the application, doing all computation and serving up dynamic content
6. What is the role of the database
The database stores, manages, updates and retrieves all data for the applications
7. What is the server using to communicate with the computer of the user requesting the website
The sever communicates using either HTTP or HTTPS protocols
-- issues are with this infrastructure --
1. SPOF
'Single Point of Failure' means that if any part of the application fails or goes down, the whole application effectively goes down with it
If for example the web server goes down, no user can acess the website
2. Downtime when maintenance needed
If maintenance needs to be done or new code needs to be deployed, in between, the application is unusable, only after is the application able
to be used
3. scaling
if there's too much incoming traffic, that one server gets overloaded and can crash
