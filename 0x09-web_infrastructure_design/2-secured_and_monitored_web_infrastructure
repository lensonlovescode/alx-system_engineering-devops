Some specifics about this infrastructure:

1. What are firewalls
Firewalls filter all incoming or outgoing traffic based on some rules

2. Why is the traffic served over HTTPS
With HTTPS, all data sent over the network is encrypted, therefore secure.

What monitoring is used for
Monitoring is used to watch metrics, record them, and alert if any anomalies that could make the computer not work properly detected.

How the monitoring tool is collecting data
Some monitoring tools require adding some piece of code into the code base like JavaScript code
this code will collect all data/metrics and send to some servers for analysis.

What to do if you want to monitor your web server QPS:
Using Web Server Logs for example Nginx Logs:

Issues are with this infrastructure:

1. Terminating SSL at the load balancer level:
Terminating SSL at the load balancer level implies that communication
between the load balancer and the servers is unencrypted (HTTP instead of HTTPS)
posing serious security issues.


2. Why having only one MySQL server capable of accepting writes is an issue:
Having only one means that a single point of failure can occur on the database
and when the database is unable to process write requests like creating new accounts ,the application
becomes unusable especially for features depending on writing to the database

3. Why having servers with all the same components (database, web server and application server) might be a problem
This brings up scalability issues for the infrastructure. 
It would require adding more servers, all which have the same components
(which can be very expensive, especially memory and CPU), duplicating the entire stack
also brings up issues with space(more space is required), power(more power is required to run
the extra servers, adding also to carbon emissions), labour and so many other issues, It's mainly a scaling issue.
